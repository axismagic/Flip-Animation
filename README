This is a NSWindow extension that allows you to flip from one window to another along the vertical axis, much like what is standard on iOS.

Usage:

NSWindow* from = ...
NSWindow* to = ...

FlipArguments* flipArgs = [[FlipArguments alloc] initWithToWindow:to flipDuration:2.5 shadowed:NO];

[from flipWithArguments:flipArgs];
